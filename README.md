# NHSBSA-Front end developer test
Front end developer test
a simple NHS login using using node.js, nunchucks.js and express.js

## Setup
- Clone repository
- Install Node version 20
- Run node app.js to start the application

- ## Notes
- run app in intelj to view data in console log.

- ## Thing would like to improve on
- Seprate out 1 question per page
- If I had more time would do aria-describedby when error to match span tag
- If I had more time would do unit testing
- Would possible add html front end tool kit sematics e.g. <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
      <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
